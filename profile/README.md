## ⚙️ Recommended PC Settings
- Prefer borderless + frame cap for smooth alt‑tabbing
- Keep textures within VRAM; drop shadows/reflections first
- Toggle DLSS/FSR/XeSS before reducing resolution
- Use in‑game benchmarks or a repeatable route for comparisons
- Rebuild shader caches after driver updates

---

## 📦 Installer & Installation Steps
- Link the correct launcher account (Steam/Epic/EA/Ubisoft/Xbox/etc.)
- Install base game; select optional components you actually use
- Verify/repair files once after install and after large patches
- Choose display mode, V‑Sync, and a sensible FPS cap
- Back up save folders before modding or DLC changes

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting
- Stutter → clear shader caches; disable overlays; verify files
- Crashes → toggle DX11/DX12/Vulkan; update drivers; check plugins
- Network issues → test NAT type, packet loss; avoid background sync
- Save conflicts → prefer newest timestamp; keep local backups
